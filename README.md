# README

In this project;
-Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
-Have at least two resources (two DB tables) on the backend; your application must have full CRUD actions for at least one resource.
-Have at least two different client-side routes using React Router.
-Implement authentication/authorization. At a minimum, a user should be able to log into the site and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash. Password protection is optional. 

# For the Backend
- After creating the react app, run "rails s" to start the server
- Create the required models for your project by running "rails g resource <model> <model-attributes> --no-test-framework"
-Create the necessary required routes for the project.
-Write code about differeny actions for the backend in the model's controllers files.
-Test your action codes if they are working using PostMan.
